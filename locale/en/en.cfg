last-user=Last user: Anonymous
; Replaces Last user: __1__
; This seems to not be used for regular tooltips. They probably concatenate username with "Last user" text on the engine side, not the normal Lua locale strings' arguments/template system. Leaving this here because it can't do harm, and for future reference.
